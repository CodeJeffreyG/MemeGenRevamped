Redoing original meme gen project with proper typescript typings and proper file managment.

The purpose is to show the difference in my skill then compared to now.

Started With NavBar created a navBar Componenent and a seperate image holding file. Imported NavBar Into app with decent styling.

See Line 7 on app.tsx created typing interface for meme state to hold memeObject that in the future will display image of meme.

The image flip API quite literally returns 100 meme Images from image flip API

See Line 21. Grabed The images from imageFlip API set the typing to string | [{}] (string or an array of objects)
